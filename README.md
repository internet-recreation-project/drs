# DRS
DRS: Domain Registration Service | ICANN Recreated.

## Overview
DRS is the IRP Domain/Registrar/TLD Registration System. Written in C, DRS allows free domain registration and free, and most importantly, quick (not 10+ years like ICANN) TLD registration. DRS is not a replacement for ICANN, but rather a free, open-source alternative that allows for the registration of domains and TLDs. IRP aims to recreate the internet, and DRS is a crucial part of that.

- Free domain registration
